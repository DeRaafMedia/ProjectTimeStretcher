ProjectTimeStretcher
====================

This project was writen as an exploration what I could do with it in the Processing.org enviroment.

Since I upgraded to Yosemite a lot of old Processing sketches broke, rather than fixing the problem I wanted to do a complete rewrite (JAVA is dead?). 

I wrote the Proccesing sketch while working for Bill Spinhoven as an emulation of his prior art (was a neat exercise).

Bill Spinhoven used the technique in some of his installations ('Alberts Ark' -> http://www.li-ma.nl/site/catalogue/doc/bill-spinhoven/alberts-ark-registratie-imago-kunstrai-1990/7833, 'Time Stretcher', e.a).

The technique used is called 'slit scanning'. A very nice explanation can be found -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhRo2WbWnKU .

This sofware is only tested with Mac OS X Yosemite, the openframeworks version used was 0.8.4 and the Xcode version was 6.1.
