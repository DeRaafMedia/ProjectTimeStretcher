ProjectTimeStretcher
====================

This is  rewrite of a Processing.org sketch to open framework. I wrote the Proccesing sketch while working for Bill Spinhoven. He used this technique in some of his installations ('Alberts Ark' -> http://www.li-ma.nl/site/catalogue/doc/bill-spinhoven/alberts-ark-registratie-imago-kunstrai-1990/7833, 'Time Stretcher', e.a).

The technique used is called 'slit scanning'. A very nice explanation can be found -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhRo2WbWnKU .
