ProjectTimeStretcher
====================

This is  rewrite of a Processing.org sketch to openframeworks. 

I wrote the Proccesing sketch while working for Bill Spinhoven as an emulation of his prior art (was a neat exercise). 

He used the technique in some of his installations ('Alberts Ark' -> http://www.li-ma.nl/site/catalogue/doc/bill-spinhoven/alberts-ark-registratie-imago-kunstrai-1990/7833, 'Time Stretcher', e.a).

The technique used is called 'slit scanning'. A very nice explanation can be found -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhRo2WbWnKU .

=======================

This sofware is only tested with Mac OS X Yosemite, the openframeworks version used was 0.8.4 and the Xcode version was 6.1.
